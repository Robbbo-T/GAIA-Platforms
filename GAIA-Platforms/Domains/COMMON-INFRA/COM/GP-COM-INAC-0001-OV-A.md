# 📜 GAIA Platforms – Overview of GAIA AIR Infranet as Infrastructural Code (InaC)

---

## 0. Definitions & Acronyms

- **InaC**: Infrastructure as Conscious Code
- **COAFI**: Canonical Orchestrated Architecture File Index
- **BITT**: Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust
- **TLS-UTidS**: Traceable Linkage System – Unique Traceable Identifiers
- **AMEDEO**: Active Meta-Ethical Dynamic Execution Ontology

---

## 1. Introduction

The **GAIA AIR INFRANET** is the living infrastructure network that enables the ethical orchestration of atmospheric, orbital, ground, and data layers. Conceived as **Infrastructure as Conscious Code (InaC)**, it transforms infrastructure into a federated, ethical, self-traceable and version-controlled living system.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of InaC is to:
- Define a conscious digital-physical infrastructure.
- Enable federated, modular, ethical orchestration across aerospace domains.
- Guarantee traceability, audibility, and regenerative sustainability through embedded ethical protocols.

---

## 3. Scope

InaC applies to:
- **Atmospheric Modules** (GP-AM, COMMERC)
- **Orbital Modules** (GP-AS, SAPR)
- **Ground Infrastructure Modules** (GP-GRO, GP-SUPL)
- **Digital Core Modules** (GP-COM, GP-PM)
- **Space Tourism Modules** (GP-ATS)

Each domain is connected and federated through Interface Domains (GP-AERO-INTERFACE).

---

## 4. Core Principles

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything is defined, documented, and executable.
- **Ethical Embedding**: Compliance with AMEDEO ethical certification embedded by design.
- **Federated Traceability**: Each asset, action, and document linked via BITT and TLS-UTidS.
- **Self-Conscious Modules**: Every infrastructural node knows its purpose, state, lineage, and ethical context.

## 6. Federation & Compliance

- All infrastructure artifacts must be:
  - Registered with a TLS-UTidS identifier.
  - Auditable through BITT.
  - Ethically validated by AMEDEO.
- Full compliance to COAFI documentation and operational standards is mandatory.

---

## 7. Future Extensions

- Full integration of **GP-ATS (Advanced Tourism Spacecraft)** into orbital-interface InaC layers.
- Expansion into **GP-URBAN** modules (smart cities, urban aerospace nodes).
- AI-native operational modules via **PET-CORE** federated cognitive engines.
