## Detailed Emergency Power Activation Process

### 1. Fault Detection and Assessment

The emergency power activation sequence begins with continuous monitoring of the aircraft's electrical system by the Power Management System Controller (PMSC). When a fault is detected, the system assesses its severity:

- **Minor Faults**: Handled through reconfiguration of the power distribution network
- **Major Faults**: Trigger the emergency power activation sequence


Major faults that can trigger emergency power activation include:

- Complete loss of both main generators
- Loss of both HVDC buses
- Multiple PDU failures
- Severe electrical system damage
- Commanded activation by flight crew


### 2. Emergency Power Sequence Initiation

Once a power emergency is declared, the PMSC initiates the emergency power sequence, which consists of four parallel processes:

#### 2.1 Emergency Battery Unit Activation

1. **Rapid Self-Test**: The EBU Battery Management System performs a rapid self-test (< 50ms)
2. **Status Verification**: Confirms operational status of the battery
3. **Contactor Closure**: Closes the main contactor to connect the EBU to the Essential DC Bus
4. **Power Delivery**: Begins delivering 28V DC power to essential systems
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitors State of Charge and battery health


#### 2.2 Ram Air Turbine Deployment

1. **Deployment Command**: PMSC sends deployment command to RAT
2. **Physical Deployment**: RAT extends from aircraft into airstream
3. **Turbine Spin-Up**: Airflow spins turbine to generate electrical power
4. **Power Generation**: RAT generator begins producing power
5. **Connection**: Power is fed to the Emergency Power Distribution Unit
6. **Monitoring**: System monitors RAT performance and output


#### 2.3 Load Shedding Protocol

1. **Level 1 Shedding**: Immediate disconnection of non-essential loads

1. In-flight entertainment
2. Galley equipment
3. Comfort lighting
4. Non-essential avionics



2. **Level 2 Shedding**: Further reduction to maintain only flight-critical systems

1. Secondary flight displays
2. Redundant systems
3. Comfort environmental control
4. Non-essential communications



3. **Power Optimization**: Dynamic adjustment of remaining loads to minimize consumption


#### 2.4 Crew Alerting

1. **EICAS Display**: Emergency power status displayed on Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System
2. **Checklist Presentation**: Electronic or paper emergency checklist provided
3. **Crew Acknowledgment**: Flight crew acknowledges the emergency
4. **Manual Control Options**: Crew can manually adjust emergency power configuration if needed


### 3. Emergency Power Management

Once emergency power sources are activated, the system enters a management phase:

#### 3.1 Power Source Prioritization

The system prioritizes power sources based on availability and flight conditions:

1. **RAT Primary**: When RAT is available and producing sufficient power, it becomes the primary source to conserve battery capacity
2. **EBU Primary**: When RAT is unavailable or insufficient, EBU serves as the primary source
3. **Optimal Sharing**: When both sources are available, the system optimizes power sharing to maximize endurance


#### 3.2 Continued Monitoring

Throughout the emergency, the system continuously monitors:

- EBU State of Charge and remaining endurance
- RAT power output and stability
- Essential system power consumption
- Status of main power system components


### 4. Recovery Sequence

If main power is recovered during flight, the system executes a recovery sequence:

1. **Synchronization**: Main power is synchronized with emergency power
2. **Load Transfer**: Loads are gradually transferred back to main power
3. **Emergency Source Securing**:

1. EBU is disconnected and placed in charging mode
2. RAT is stowed (if flight conditions permit)



4. **Return to Normal**: System returns to normal power configuration
5. **Post-Emergency Checks**: System performs comprehensive checks of all components


## Emergency Power System Timing

| Event | Timing | Notes
|-----|-----|-----
| Fault Detection | < 10ms | From fault occurrence to detection
| Emergency Declaration | < 20ms | From detection to emergency declaration
| EBU Activation | < 100ms | From declaration to power available
| RAT Deployment Command | < 50ms | From declaration to deployment command
| RAT Full Deployment | 2-3 seconds | Physical deployment time
| RAT Power Available | 3-5 seconds | From deployment to power generation
| Load Shed Level 1 | < 200ms | From declaration to non-essential load shedding
| Load Shed Level 2 | < 500ms | From declaration to flight-critical configuration
| Crew Alert | < 100ms | From declaration to EICAS display
| Total Time to Stable Emergency Power | < 5 seconds | Complete sequence time


## Emergency Power Endurance

The emergency power system is designed to provide the following endurance:

| Configuration | Minimum Endurance | Notes
|-----|-----|-----
| EBU Only | 60 minutes | At essential loads only
| RAT Only | Unlimited | While maintaining sufficient airspeed
| EBU + RAT | Extended | RAT primary with EBU supplementing as needed


## Special Case: Ground Emergency

If a power emergency occurs while the aircraft is on the ground:

1. EBU activates as the primary power source
2. RAT deployment is inhibited
3. Additional load shedding may be implemented to extend battery life
4. External power connection is prioritized if available
5. APU start is attempted if available and not the source of the fault


## Special Case: Dual Failure

In the extremely rare case of both EBU and RAT failure:

1. System attempts to isolate and recover partial main power if possible
2. Ultimate fallback to critical battery-powered instruments with direct battery connection
3. Minimum flight control power maintained for safe landing
4. Flight crew receives specific alerts for this condition

The file paths, document types, and organization structure are suggested based on aerospace industry standards and the provided GAIA AIR framework requirements.

## Overview

Effective thermal management is critical for the safe and efficient operation of aircraft battery systems. The AMPEL360XWLRGA incorporates two distinct battery thermal management systems:

1. **Primary Battery System Thermal Management (PBSTM)**: An active liquid cooling system for the high-power lithium-ion primary battery system.
2. **Emergency Battery Unit Thermal Management (EBUTM)**: A primarily passive system with supplemental heating for the LiFePO₄ emergency battery unit.


These systems are designed to maintain optimal battery temperatures across all operating conditions while meeting the specific requirements of each battery system's role and chemistry.

## Primary Battery System Thermal Management (PBSTM)

The PBSTM is designed to handle the significant heat generation of the high-power NMC/LTO hybrid cells during charge and discharge cycles, particularly during high-power operations.
