### ATA 00: Intro & General

| ATA Track ID | Title | System Instruction | ELPACK |
|:-------------|:------|:-------------------|:-------|
| **00-10** | **GP-AMPEL Requirements Management & Design Traceability** | Establish comprehensive requirements management and design traceability in accordance with **AS9100**, integrating environmental considerations from project launch per **ISO 14001**. Ensure global compliance with the applicable **EASA CS-25** certification basis. Generate the programme **BREX** (Business Rules Exchange) file to govern S1000D technical-data production. | .xml |
| 00-10-01 | Requirements Identification and Control | `System Instruction: Implement unique GP-AMPEL ID system for all requirements (system, subsystem, component). Include metadata for author, creation date, modification history, and approval status. Establish version control system for requirement evolution throughout project lifecycle.` | .md, .xml |
| 00-10-02 | Bidirectional Traceability Framework | `System Instruction: Establish and maintain links between requirements and corresponding design documents (Design Solutions identified by DES-ID), Bill of Materials Part Numbers (PN-ID), test cases, and certification compliance evidence. Ensure bidirectional traceability to track forward (requirement → design → verification) and backward (verification → design → requirement).` | .json, .xml |
| 00-10-03 | Real-time Impact Analysis System | `System Instruction: Implement real-time assessment capability for requirement changes, visualizing impacts across design elements, tests, certification status, and environmental considerations. Configure automated alerts within GP-AMPEL for affected stakeholders.` | .json, .md |
| 00-10-04 | AS9100 Alignment Documentation | `System Instruction: Document explicit integration with AS9100 clauses, particularly Clause 8.3 (design and development processes) and Clause 8.5.6 (Change Management workflows). Ensure all design changes are traceable, approved, and documented within GP-AMPEL.` | .pdf, .md |
| 00-10-05 | Environmental Integration (ISO 14001) | `System Instruction: Document environmental impacts identified at project initiation. Establish continuous traceability of environmental objectives throughout requirements and design phases. Align requirement management activities with ISO 14001 environmental performance tracking.` | .pdf, .md |
| 00-10-06 | EASA CS-25 Compliance Mapping | `System Instruction: Structure requirements explicitly to demonstrate compliance with EASA CS-25 certification standards. Maintain a clear mapping of requirements to certification criteria and verification documents within GP-AMPEL.` | .xml, .pdf |
| 00-10-07 | S1000D BREX File Generation | `System Instruction: Implement automated generation and maintenance of the BREX (Business Rules Exchange) file from GP-AMPEL requirements database. Ensure BREX file governs all technical data production, ensuring consistent adherence to predefined business rules. Configure GP-AMPEL for continuous synchronization of requirements with the BREX for accuracy and compliance.` | .xml |
| 00-10-08 | Controlled Glossary Integration | `System Instruction: Link all documentation and requirement descriptions directly to a controlled glossary (APP-A) within GP-AMPEL, ensuring consistent terminology usage.` | .md, .xml |
| 00-10-09 | Reporting and Auditability System | `System Instruction: Implement customizable reports and audit trails generated directly from GP-AMPEL for internal reviews, external audits, and certification activities. Ensure full historical traceability of requirement changes, design decisions, associated DES-ID, PN-ID, and compliance evidence.` | .pdf, .json |
| 00-20 | Abbreviations and Terminology | `System Instruction: Link relevant Design Solution (DES-ID) & BOM Part Numbers (PN-ID). Link to controlled glossary (APP-A).` | .md |
| **DT-ROI** | **Digital Twin Return on Investment Framework** | | |
| DT-ROI-10 | -- Overview of DT-ROI Application in GP-AM Lifecycle | `System Instruction: Link relevant Design Solution (DES-ID) & BOM Part Numbers (PN-ID). Describe how DT-ROI applies to airframe/system decisions.` | .md |
| DT-ROI-20 | -- Link to Core DT-ROI Framework Definition (GP-PMO) | `System Instruction: Link relevant Design Solution (DES-ID) & BOM Part Numbers (PN-ID). Provide cross-reference to GP-PMO core DT-ROI methodology.` | .md |
| DT-ROI-30 | -- Key ROI Metrics & Calculation Guidance for Airframe Applications | `System Instruction: Link relevant Design Solution (DES-ID) & BOM Part Numbers (PN-ID). Define specific metrics (weight reduction, maint. cost saving) for GP-AM.` | .md |
