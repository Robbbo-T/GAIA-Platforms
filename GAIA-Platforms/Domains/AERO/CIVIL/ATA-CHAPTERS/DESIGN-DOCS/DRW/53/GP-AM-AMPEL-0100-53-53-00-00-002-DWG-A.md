## 2. General Arrangement Drawing

### 2.1 Fuselage Overview

![Fuselage General Arrangement Drawing](https://hebbkx1anhila5yf.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/image-PPQLwLNzf2tnibSWO5I4NzCpZXEhqa.png)

The AMPEL8©XWLRGA fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with advanced composite materials and intelligent structural health monitoring. The fuselage measures approximately 58.6m in length with a circular cross-section as shown in the front views.

### 2.2 Material Zones

As indicated in the drawing legend:
- Carbon BNNT Composite: Primary structure material for most of the forward fuselage
- Titanium-Alloy Reinforcement: Used in high-stress areas, particularly in the center section
- Aluminum-Lithium Alloy: Used in the aft section for weight optimization
- Titanium-Ceramic Composite: Used in high-temperature areas

For detailed material specifications, refer to GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-51-00-00-00-SPEC-A.md.
