## 4. Cross-Sections

The fuselage features a circular cross-section with a maximum width of 6.2 m (20'3"). The cross-sectional design optimizes structural integrity while minimizing weight.

### 4.1 Wing Integration

The wing-to-fuselage integration occurs at approximately the center section of the fuselage. The wingspan measures 52.0 m (170.6 ft) from wingtip to wingtip.

### 4.2 Landing Gear Integration

The main landing gear is positioned beneath the wing attachment points with a ground clearance of 1.2 m (4'11").

## 5. Material Specifications

The AMPEL360XWLRGA utilizes advanced materials including:

- Carbon BNNT Composite: Primary structure material for most of the forward fuselage
- Titanium-Alloy Reinforcement: Used in high-stress areas, particularly in the center section
- Aluminum-Lithium Alloy: Used in the aft section for weight optimization
- Titanium-Ceramic Composite: Used in high-temperature areas

For detailed material specifications, refer to GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-51-00-00-00-SPEC-A.md.
