## 1. Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a standardized electrical charging interface between Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and GAIA Platforms-compliant aircraft (including Commercial, UAM, and potentially others). The goal is to ensure interoperability, safety, efficiency, and data integrity during high-power charging operations at airports, vertiports, and spaceports.

This interface is critical for enabling sustainable aviation powered by electricity and supports the GAIA principles of interoperability, lifecycle efficiency, and **AI-driven optimization co-orchestrated with human oversight (Human-in-the-Loop - HITL)**.

---

## 2. Scope

* Defines the physical connector type(s) and characteristics for high-power DC charging.
* Specifies the electrical requirements (voltage, current ranges, power levels up to megawatt scale).
* Outlines the communication protocol between the aircraft and the charging station (EVSE - Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment adapted for aviation), supporting both automated/AI-driven commands and human-initiated actions.
* Details safety mechanisms, including insulation monitoring, interlocking, and emergency shutdown procedures, operable by both automated systems and humans.
* Covers data exchange requirements for charging control, status monitoring, billing/authentication (linking to GP-COM Federated FinTech Layer), battery health diagnostics, and data necessary for AI-driven optimization (e.g., grid status, flight schedules, energy pricing).
* Addresses potential bidirectional power flow (V2G/A2G) capabilities, potentially managed by AI with HITL confirmation.
* Ensures compliance with relevant emerging aviation and automotive charging standards (e.g., adaptation of MCS, ISO 15118).

### 9.5 Environmental Integration (ISO 14001)

Document environmental impacts identified at project initiation. Establish continuous traceability of environmental objectives throughout requirements and design phases. Align requirement management activities with ISO 14001 environmental performance tracking.

### 9.6 EASA CS-25 Compliance Mapping

Structure requirements explicitly to demonstrate compliance with EASA CS-25 certification standards. Maintain a clear mapping of requirements to certification criteria and verification documents within GP-AMPEL.

### 9.7 S1000D BREX File Generation

Implement automated generation and maintenance of the BREX (Business Rules Exchange) file from GP-AMPEL requirements database. Ensure BREX file governs all technical data production, ensuring consistent adherence to predefined business rules. Configure GP-AMPEL for continuous synchronization of requirements with the BREX for accuracy and compliance.

### 9.8 Controlled Glossary Integration
