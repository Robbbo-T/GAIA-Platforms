### 4.1 BITT_ID Structure and Meaning

The `BITT_ID` is a unique identifier used to immutably record specific events, requirements, or artifacts in the BITT (Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust) ledger. It serves as a verifiable pointer for traceability and auditing within the GAIA ecosystem, managed via COAFI.

**Example Structure:**

`BITT_ID: DOMAIN-SUBDOMAIN-ATASYSTEM-ITEMNUMBER-VERSION-ARTIFACTID`

**Example Breakdown (`BITT_ID: CIVIL-AV-42-003-v1p0-FR001`):**

* **`CIVIL`**: Main Domain (Civil Aviation).
* **`AV`**: Sub-domain or Area (Avionics).
* **`42`**: System/Chapter code (potentially aligned with ATA 100, e.g., ATA 42 - Integrated Modular Avionics).
* **`003`**: Sequential number or identifier for the specific item within the system/chapter.
* **`v1p0`**: Version of the artifact (document, requirement) this ID refers to (v1.0 in this case).
* **`FR001`**: Unique identifier for the specific artifact within its context (Functional Requirement 001).

This structure allows for clear, contextualized identification of each item recorded in BITT, facilitating navigation and verification through COAFI.

## 5 Architectural Overview

The integrated avionics architecture follows a federated, modular design emphasizing redundancy, security, and AI-enhanced capabilities.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/Robbbo-T/GAIA-Platforms/raw/main/GAIA-Platforms/Domains/AERO/CIVIL/COMMERCIAL/IMG/mermaid-ai-diagram-2025-04-26-171953.svg" alt="Architectural Diagram" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

**Component Interaction:**

* **FMMS (Federated Mission Management System):** Acts as the high-level coordinator, managing flight plans, operational modes, and potentially orchestrating dynamic reconfiguration of CAPU resources based on mission phase or system health. Communicates with CAPUs via the AFDX network.
* **CAPU (Core Avionics Processing Unit):** Redundant processing units (CAPU-A, CAPU-B) host critical flight functions and applications in partitioned ARINC 653 environments. They execute tasks assigned by FMMS and process data from various aircraft systems. Communication between CAPUs for redundancy management occurs over AFDX.
* **RAIM (Regenerative AI Module):** A specialized cluster providing AI/ML capabilities. It processes data (potentially received via AFDX from CAPUs or sensors) for functions like predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, or decision support. It interacts with the BITT Ledger for logging insights or potentially verifying ethical constraints via AMEDEO protocols.
* **QESC (Quantum-Enhanced Secure Channel):** Provides highly secure, potentially post-quantum communication links. It connects the onboard systems (CAPUs) to external networks, primarily the Ground BITT Hub, ensuring secure transmission of sensitive data, software updates, and traceability logs.
* **BITT Ledger (Onboard):** An onboard instance or secure cache of the Blockchain Integrated Traceability & Trust ledger. It primarily serves for local verification of configuration, software integrity, or logged events. Critical logs and attestations generated by RAIM or CAPUs are securely transmitted via QESC to the main Ground BITT Hub.
* **Ground BITT Hub:** The off-aircraft, authoritative instance of the BITT blockchain, ensuring global consistency and immutability of the traceability records across the federated GAIA ecosystem.

**Data Flow:** Standard operational data flows primarily over the deterministic AFDX network. High-security communications and BITT synchronization utilize the QESC. AI modules interact with both AFDX (for data input) and potentially directly with BITT/QESC for logging and secure updates.

## 6 Validation Plan

The validation strategy ensures compliance with functional, safety, security, and ethical requirements through a multi-faceted approach:

* **Functional Bench Tests:**
    * Simulate INTRO-ATMOSPHERIC flight phases and environmental conditions.
    * Verify CAPU processing performance under nominal and peak loads.
    * Validate FMMS mission orchestration and dynamic reconfiguration commands (FR-001, FR-006).
    * Test RAIM predictive maintenance algorithm accuracy against simulated fault data (FR-007).
    * Confirm AFDX network performance (latency, bandwidth, determinism) meets specifications.
* **Redundancy & Fail-Safe Verification:**
    * Conduct fault injection testing on CAPU-A/B to verify failover mechanisms per CS-25 (FR-004).
    * Validate ARINC 653 partitioning integrity under failure conditions (FR-008).
    * Perform SOTIF analysis for AI functions in RAIM (FR-002).
* **AI Ethical Compliance Audit:**
    * Utilize AMEDEO-certified test pipelines and datasets to audit RAIM decision-making against ethical rules defined in [`GP-COM-ETHICS-AMEDEO-DEF-A`](../../../GP-COM/GP-COM-ETHICS-AMEDEO-DEF-A.md) (FR-002).
    * Verify logging of ethical compliance checks to BITT.
* **Network Security Audit:**
    * Penetration testing of AFDX and QESC interfaces following DO-326A/DO-356A methodologies.
    * Verification of QESC post-quantum key exchange strength (CSR-002).
    * Audit of secure boot processes and image verification (CSR-003).
    * Validation of BITT logging mechanisms for traceability and intrusion detection (FR-003, CSR-004, FR-010).
    * Verification of secure software update deployment mechanisms via QESC (FR-005).
* **COAFI Compliance Check:**
    * Ensure all documentation, requirements (linked via UTidS), and test results are correctly indexed and accessible via the COAFI system.

### 10.2 Bidirectional Traceability Framework

Establish and maintain links between requirements and corresponding design documents (Design Solutions identified by DES-ID), Bill of Materials Part Numbers (PN-ID), test cases, and certification compliance evidence. Ensure bidirectional traceability to track forward (requirement → design → verification) and backward (verification → design → requirement).

### 10.3 Real-time Impact Analysis System

Implement real-time assessment capability for requirement changes, visualizing impacts across design elements, tests, certification status, and environmental considerations. Configure automated alerts within GP-AMPEL for affected stakeholders.

### 10.4 AS9100 Alignment Documentation
