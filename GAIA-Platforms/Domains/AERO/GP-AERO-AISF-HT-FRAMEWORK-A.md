# Aerospace Information Sustainability High-Tech Framework (AISF-HT)

## I. Introduction

**AISF-HT** defines the principles, architecture, and practices needed to ensure the long-term **sustainability**, **integrity**, and **regenerative value** of information assets in **civil aerospace and green technologies**.
It is a core module within the **GAIA Platforms** vision and the **WorldWideWinner Regenerative AI Engineering Project (WWW.RE-GEN-AI.PROJECT)**.

Information is treated as a **living resource**, critical for human, planetary, and interplanetary development.

---

## II. Core Principles

* **Ethical Stewardship:** All information must support life, dignity, and ecological harmony.
* **Federated Knowledge Integrity:** Cross-organization, cross-generation preservation of aerospace data.
* **Quantum-Resilient Traceability:** Future-proofing data against quantum threats (using COAFI + BITT standards).
* **Lifecycle Efficiency:** Reduction of informational waste through semantic organization and orchestration.
* **Civil and Environmental Regeneration:** Enabling reuse and transformation of aerospace data for civil sustainability efforts.

---

## III. Architecture

### 1. Domains Covered

* Civil Aerospace Engineering
* Atmospheric and Space Programs
* Renewable Energy Systems
* Sustainable Mobility and Transportation
* Scientific Research and Open Innovation

### 2. Systems Integrated

* **COAFI:** Canonical structuring of documents and information artifacts.
* **QAO:** Federated adaptive orchestration of information workflows.
* **AMEDEO:** Ethical validation and certification for information lifecycle.
* **AMPEL:** Semantic dynamization and programming of informational ecosystems.
* **BITT:** Blockchain-enhanced traceability and integrity anchoring.

---

## IV. Key Goals

* **Preserve** aerospace engineering knowledge across centuries.
* **Ensure** open ethical access to civil information systems.
* **Promote** the regenerative cycle between aerospace, green tech, and civil society.
* **Audit** information quality through federated ethical validation.
* **Minimize** informational entropy through elastic organization.

## V. AISF-HT Operational Layers

```plaintext
1. Information Creation and Collection
2. Semantic Structuring and COAFI Canonicalization
3. Ethical Validation and Governance (AMEDEO)
4. Federated Adaptive Orchestration (QAO Layer)
5. Secure Preservation and Regenerative Pathways (BITT Layer)
```

## VI. Synergies with WorldWideWinner RE-GEN-AI.PROJECT

AISF-HT acts as a **pillar** for:

* Global regenerative knowledge networks.
* Ethical AI-driven data augmentation.
* Long-term preservation of aerospace innovation lifecycles.
* Civil knowledge empowerment through transparent data stewardship.

## VII. Requirements Management and Design Traceability

### 1. Requirements Identification and Control

Implement a unique GP-AMPEL ID system for all requirements (system, subsystem, component). Include metadata for author, creation date, modification history, and approval status. Establish a version control system for requirement evolution throughout the project lifecycle.

### 2. Bidirectional Traceability Framework

Establish and maintain links between requirements and corresponding design documents (Design Solutions identified by DES-ID), Bill of Materials Part Numbers (PN-ID), test cases, and certification compliance evidence. Ensure bidirectional traceability to track forward (requirement â†’ design â†’ verification) and backward (verification â†’ design â†’ requirement).

### 3. Real-time Impact Analysis System

Implement real-time assessment capability for requirement changes, visualizing impacts across design elements, tests, certification status, and environmental considerations. Configure automated alerts within GP-AMPEL for affected stakeholders.

### 4. AS9100 Alignment Documentation

Document explicit integration with AS9100 clauses, particularly Clause 8.3 (design and development processes) and Clause 8.5.6 (Change Management workflows). Ensure all design changes are traceable, approved, and documented within GP-AMPEL.

### 5. Environmental Integration (ISO 14001)

Document environmental impacts identified at project initiation. Establish continuous traceability of environmental objectives throughout requirements and design phases. Align requirement management activities with ISO 14001 environmental performance tracking.

### 6. EASA CS-25 Compliance Mapping

Structure requirements explicitly to demonstrate compliance with EASA CS-25 certification standards. Maintain a clear mapping of requirements to certification criteria and verification documents within GP-AMPEL.

### 7. S1000D BREX File Generation

Implement automated generation and maintenance of the BREX (Business Rules Exchange) file from GP-AMPEL requirements database. Ensure BREX file governs all technical data production, ensuring consistent adherence to predefined business rules. Configure GP-AMPEL for continuous synchronization of requirements with the BREX for accuracy and compliance.

### 8. Controlled Glossary Integration

Link all documentation and requirement descriptions directly to a controlled glossary (APP-A) within GP-AMPEL, ensuring consistent terminology usage.

### 9. Reporting and Auditability System

Implement customizable reports and audit trails generated directly from GP-AMPEL for internal reviews, external audits, and certification activities. Ensure full historical traceability of requirement changes, design decisions, associated DES-ID, PN-ID, and compliance evidence.
