# üìú GAIA Platforms ‚Äì Semantic Source Classification Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This protocol establishes the mandatory classification system for all external and internal digital sources referenced within GAIA Platforms, ensuring rigorous separation between verified, speculative, and creative materials to maintain document integrity, auditability, and ethical compliance. It also includes comprehensive requirements management and design traceability in accordance with AS9100, ISO 14001, EASA CS-25, and S1000D BREX.

## 2. Core Classification Rules

### 2.1 Domain Categorization

Each source must be classified explicitly into one domain:

| Domain | Description |
|:---|:---|
| F√≠sico-Teor√©tico | Physics, Cosmology, Quantum Science, Standard Models |
| Matem√°tico (Comprobado) | Theorems, Formal Proofs, Statistical Models |
| Ingenier√≠a Aplicada | Aerospace, Mechanical, Electrical Engineering (verified) |
| Biom√©dico | Medicine, Biology, Pharmacology (peer-reviewed) |
| Especulativo-Creativo | Hypothetical frameworks, Narrative Constructs, Artistic Designs |
| Art√≠stico/Narrativo | Fiction, Mythology, Storytelling |

---

### 2.2 Verification Level

Each source must also be annotated by its level of verification:

| Verification Level | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Peer-Reviewed | Published in journals or conferences with formal peer review |
| Preprint (Trusted) | Preprint repositories with scientific community recognition (e.g., arXiv) |
| Speculative (AI/Creative) | Generated through speculative design, AI, or conceptual narrative |
| Unverified | No formal validation (must be used cautiously) |

---

### 2.3 Applicability Context

Sources must specify their intended context of use:

| Applicability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Research | Academic, fundamental or applied research usage |
| Engineering | Application in real-world projects, certifications, systems development |
| Narrative/Fiction | Use in speculative, fictional, or artistic projects |
| Educational | Learning, teaching, academic dissemination |

---

## 3. Metadata Header for Sources

All sources referenced or cataloged must include the following YAML metadata:

```yaml
domain: "F√≠sico-Teor√©tico"
verification: "Peer-Reviewed"
source: "Physical Review Letters"
applicability: "Research"
confidence_level: 98%
```

Example for a creative document:

```yaml
domain: "Especulativo-Creativo"
verification: "Speculative (AI/Creative)"
source: "Narrative Prototype by GAIA Platforms"
applicability: "Narrative/Fiction"
confidence_level: 60%
```

---

## 4. Enforcement of Classification (LUII-002)

- **No merging** of speculative sources into verified scientific domains without explicit labeling.
- **Mandatory metadata** for all stored or referenced sources.
- **Clear domain separation** in documentation and knowledge graphs.
- **Auditability**: Every data ingestion pipeline must respect and log source classification.

---

## 5. Activation and Compliance

- This protocol is effective immediately across GAIA Platforms documentation and systems.
- All new or existing sources must be reviewed and classified accordingly.
- Classification audits will be part of regular QA/QC reviews within COAFI and GAIA AIR programs.
