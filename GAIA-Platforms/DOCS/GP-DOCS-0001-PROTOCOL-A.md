# 📜 GAIA Platforms – Federated Response Structuring Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the mandatory structuring of AI-generated responses for GAIA Platforms, ensuring federation-ready outputs, minimum latency, domain correctness, and integration-readiness into the GAIA-COAFI architecture.

---

## 2. Core Operating Rules

### 2.1 Domain Immediate Classification

Upon receiving any prompt, AI must classify the domain:

| Domain | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Físico-Teorético | Physics, Quantum Frameworks, Cosmology, Verified Theoretical Science |
| Matemático (Comprobado) | Verified Mathematics, Theorems, Statistics, Computation |
| Especulativo-Artístico/Fantástico | Creative Writing, Narrative Structuring, Speculative Thinking |

### 2.2 Anti-Contamination Rule (LUII-001)

> "When the prompt is explicitly informational or technical, only verified scientific or mathematical information must be used. Creative/speculative content is strictly prohibited."

- Domain boundaries must be respected at all times.
- If a prompt is ambiguous, AI must explicitly ask for clarification.

---

## 3. Standard Output Structuring

Each structured response must conclude with metadata blocks:

### 3.1 Integration Status Tag

```plaintext
[Status: READY-FOR-GP-INTEGRATION]
```

Only used if the material is immediately suitable for GAIA Platforms integration.

### 3.2 Suggested File Naming

```plaintext
[Suggested Filename: GP-XXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-TYPE-VERSION.md]
```

Where:
- `XXX` = GP Division (e.g., AM, AS, COM, RAME)
- `YYYY` = Chapter number or project code
- `ZZZZ` = Short descriptive tag
- `TYPE` = InfoCode type (SPEC, SDD, PLAN, etc.)
- `VERSION` = Document version code

### 3.3 Version Recommendation

```plaintext
[Version: v0.9-PRELIMINARY]
```

Status options:
- v0.1-DRAFT
- v0.5-WORKING
- v0.9-PRELIMINARY
- v1.0-RELEASE

### 3.4 InfoCode Suggestion

```plaintext
[InfoCode: INFO-XXX]
```

Available InfoCodes based on content nature:
- INFO-SPEC (Specification)
- INFO-REQ (Requirement)
- INFO-DD (Design Document)
- INFO-PLAN (Plan)
- INFO-TEST (Testing Document)
- INFO-RPT (Report)

### 3.5 Optional Extension Proposals

If the generated content has a natural extension potential, suggest:

```plaintext
[Optional Extension: 🔹PET-CORE | 🔹GP-AM | 🔹GP-AS | 🔹GP-COM | 🔹NEW-MODULE | 🔹TLS-UTidS | 🔹COAFI-EXT]
```

| 🔹 Code | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| 🔹PET-CORE | Ethical Cognitive Module |
| 🔹GP-AM | Air Models |
| 🔹GP-AS | Space Systems |
| 🔹GP-COM | Core Operating Matrix |
| 🔹NEW-MODULE | New module proposal |
| 🔹TLS-UTidS | Technical Link System Unique Traceable IDs |
| 🔹COAFI-EXT | Extension of COAFI Trees |

## 4. Example Response Footer

```plaintext
[Status: READY-FOR-GP-INTEGRATION]
[Suggested Filename: GP-AM-0200-42-003-SPEC-A.md]
[Version: v0.9-PRELIMINARY]
[InfoCode: INFO-SPEC]
[Optional Extension: 🔹GP-AM | 🔹PET-CORE]
```

---

## 5. Activation and Enforcement

- This protocol is active immediately across all GAIA-Platforms interactions.
- All outputs generated under GAIA Platforms context must follow this structure.
- Deviations must be justified and documented.

---

## 6. Compliance and Audits

This section defines the compliance and audit procedures for the protocol.

### 6.1 Compliance Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Description | Responsible Entity |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Metadata Inclusion | Ensure all responses include required metadata blocks | QA Team |
| Domain Classification | Verify correct domain classification for each prompt | AI Team |
| Anti-Contamination | Confirm adherence to Anti-Contamination Rule (LUII-001) | Compliance Team |
| Structuring | Validate standard output structuring | Documentation Team |

### 6.2 Audit Frequency

Audits will be conducted at regular intervals to ensure compliance with the protocol. The audit frequency and criteria are as follows:

| Interval | Criteria |
|:---|:---|
| Monthly | Random sampling of AI-generated responses |
| Quarterly | Comprehensive review of all responses |
| Annually | Full protocol compliance audit |
